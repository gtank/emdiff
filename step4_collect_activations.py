Step 4: Collect activations from all three model conditions

This script collects neural activations from:
1. Baseline model (no behavioral modification)
2. In-context prompted model (risky behavioral prompt)
3. Fine-tuned model (learned risky behavior)

Addresses reviewer feedback by using diverse test prompts separate from training data.
